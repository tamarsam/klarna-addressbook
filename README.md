# klarna-addressbook

**To run server on Linux:**
`klarna-venv/bin/python addressbook/manage.py runserver`

Access the application at <localhost:8000/search>

If the database appears to be empty (e.g., all searches return no results), run `./load_db.sh` and then run the server again.

Thank you and enjoy!
